ðŸ“ˆ Customer Engagement Data Analysis Project

This Power BI project analyzes marketing performance and customer behavior for a fictional sports-related business. Using structured data on customers, 
products, locations, and engagement metrics, the dashboard enables marketing and data teams to uncover actionable insights to optimize content strategies, product targeting, and campaign performance.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project includes four datasets:

Customers: Demographic details linked to geographic locations.

Products: Product catalog including category and price.

Geography: Location data for cities and countries.

Engagement: Interaction metrics (likes, views, clicks) tied to marketing campaigns and content types.

The dashboard and analysis provide deep insights into customer segmentation, content effectiveness, and regional preferences using tools such as Power BI, Python, and SQL.

ðŸ§  Key Insights

Top Engagement Channels: Social media and newsletters drive the highest views and clicks.

Product Performance: High-value items like Yoga Mats and Golf Clubs often receive more engagement than lower-priced products.

Customer Segments: Younger customers (ages 18â€“30) show more interaction with video content.

Regional Trends: Cities like Berlin and London show significant differences in preferred content types.

Campaign Analysis: Certain campaigns (e.g., CampaignID 3) consistently outperform others across all channels.
